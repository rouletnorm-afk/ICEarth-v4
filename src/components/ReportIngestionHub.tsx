  const BEN_FRANKLIN_ARTICLE = `Benjamin Franklin and a Useful Truth
Bruce Lanphear
Jul 05, 2026

Benjamin Franklin helped found the United States—but he also helped uncover one of history’s oldest environmental poisons.

Benjamin Franklin is one of my favorite figures from the American Revolution—not because he was flawless, but because he seemed endlessly curious about how the world worked and how life might be made a little better, safer, wiser, and more humane.

He was a printer, inventor, diplomat, humorist, scientist, abolitionist, and political strategist. He helped found the United States, the Library Company of Philadelphia, the American Philosophical Society, the Union Fire Company, and the Pennsylvania Hospital. He studied storms, ocean currents, and electricity. He invented bifocals because he was tired of changing glasses.

But on the 250th anniversary of the United States, I find myself thinking about another Franklin. Not the statesman under chandeliers in Paris, but the observant young printer who noticed that certain trades seemed to leave people crippled, sickened, or in pain.

Franklin may have been one of America’s first great observers of environmental health.

And he understood something we still struggle to accept today: prevention depends not only on discovering danger, but on whether society is willing to act before more people are harmed.

In 1786, late in life, Franklin wrote one of the most haunting sentences in the history of public health:

“So sensible is the effect of lead poison that the physicians have long been acquainted with it… and yet it is a long time since the mischievous effect from lead taken internally has been known; and how long a useful truth may be known, and exist, before it is generally received and practiced on …”

The sentence still feels painfully modern. Franklin understood that the obstacle was rarely ignorance alone. Often the greater obstacle was delay.

The human tendency to normalize familiar harms. The reluctance to disturb commerce. The hope that uncertainty might excuse inaction. The temptation to wait for absolute proof while the damage accumulates quietly in homes, workplaces, and communities.

This may be Franklin’s most overlooked contribution—not merely that he recognized lead as dangerous, but that he recognized the social pattern surrounding dangerous knowledge.

A useful truth may exist for decades before society is willing to practice upon it.`;

By Chris Quinn, Editor, cleveland.com/The Plain Dealer
Jul 11, 2026

Note: This is part 2 of a 5-part opinion project from cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer

Before Henry A. Sherwin came along, America couldn’t buy pre-mixed paint in a can.

Paint, when it was used at all before the Civil War, was prepared by professional painters who broke up cakes of white lead by hand for pigment and mixed it into linseed oil of varying quality. As you might imagine, crumbling lead by hand generated no end of dust. A lot of painters died of lead poisoning.`;

Note: This is part 3 of a 5-part opinion project from cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer

Despite clear internal knowledge and industry awareness regarding the devastating neurological impact of white lead on workers and children, paint manufacturers like Sherwin-Williams aggressively marketed and distributed toxic pigments. 

Using historical archives (such as the Toxic Docs repository), Part 3 exposes the documented trail showing that the industry prioritized market share and corporate growth over pediatric health, knowing fully the cognitive and physiological price of their product. This is an unprecedented metropolitan editorial confession.`;

Note: This is part 4 of a 5-part opinion project from cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer

Baltimore gets credit as ground zero in America’s inevitable battle to save children from lead paint poisoning.

In short, Sherwin-Williams knew its paint was a dangerous poison but persuaded people to coat their homes with it, inside and out. Like I said in part 3, forget everything you thought you knew about the paint companies not knowing their products were hazardous. They knew. And they worked to keep America from finding out.

Such arguments would never be heard back here in Ohio. A bunch of cities -- not including Cleveland -- and later the attorney general filed suit against Sherwin-Williams and the others after the Rhode Island verdict. But the Ohio legislature quickly passed a law to block such lawsuits. As lawmakers have done so often, for gas and oil, tobacco, electric utilities and lately data centers, they opted to protect the health of corporations instead of the health of the people. Because of the new law, all of the Ohio lawsuits were dismissed.

The only place in America with pending lead paint cases today is Wisconsin, where four longstanding lawsuits have been whittled back but still have unresolved claims.

Sherwin-Williams, however, worries that more could be ahead. Federal law requires the company to disclose any potential for future lawsuit liabilities, and in its annual reports, including its most recent in 2025, it makes clear what it fears:

"The Company expects that additional lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation may be filed against the Company in the future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking similar or different types of damages and relief. The Company will continue to vigorously defend against any additional litigation that may be filed, including utilizing all avenues of appeal, if necessary."

We don’t think lawsuits are the answer to the lead paint problem. We think there’s a better way. And in our fifth and final installment of this series, we think we’ll surprise you with how we believe Sherwin-Williams should be part of the solution.

Additionally, this connects to Baltimore, where the infamous Baltimore Lead Paint Study (the Kennedy Krieger Institute study) compromised medical ethics, denying Black children adequate lead paint prevention and monitoring toxic exposures as a mere data stream. Since 1921, government, legal, medical, scientific, and journalistic malpractice has allowed environmental justice to be delayed and racistly obstructed.`;
  
  const CLEVELAND_QUINN_PART5 = `The right thing to do: Our Sherwin-Williams Dilemma, Part 5
By Chris Quinn, Editor, cleveland.com/The Plain Dealer
Published: Jul. 14, 2026, 5:00 a.m.

Note: This is the last installment of a 5-part opinion project from cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer

One reason we’ve undertaken this series is that Cleveland, home of Sherwin-Williams, ranks as one of America’s worst cities for childhood lead poisoning.

Blame bad timing. The years when the city’s population and housing boomed, lead paint was flowing like a river from Sherwin-Williams and other paint plants.

More than 40 percent of Cleveland’s housing stock was built before 1920, according to an Atlas of ReUrbanism study. Another 35 percent of it was built before 1940. That means more than three-quarters of Cleveland’s houses were built when lead paint was supreme. And most of the rest of it was built when exteriors were still being coated with lead. Cleveland’s homes are loaded with poison.

And every year, more children ingest it, damaging their brains to the point where they can’t handle basic math and other tasks. Thousands more children every decade. The great potential they came into the world with is crushed in their infancies because of what paint companies did a century ago.

The Plain Dealer and cleveland.com have chronicled the repeated, chronic failures of city health programs to solve the problem, most notably in a series called Toxic Neglect more than a decade ago. Nothing has worked. The poison on the walls, doors and windows continues to wreck lives.

In this final installment of our series, we offer an idea for a permanent solution, one that would once and for all get the lead out of Cleveland. And we suggest a key role for Sherwin-Williams: provide the leadership, innovation, and tenacity we need. It’s the right thing to do. It’s in the company’s DNA.

"These responsibilities go beyond paying taxes and complying with numerous laws and regulations. They call for active involvement, leadership and real contribution toward solving community problems wherever it is practical and realistic for our Company to participate." — Walter O. Spencer, Sherwin-Williams CEO, 1973`;

  const INDIA_MIRNA31_ARTICLE = `Association of miRNA-31 & miRNA 192 with Nrf2/NF-κB Biomarkers in Occupational Lead Toxicity: A Cross-Sectional Observational Study

Kanishka Kumar, Sudha Anjali, Shailja Sharma, Shweta Rana, Purvi Purohit, Mithu Banerjee, Dharmveer Yadav & Praveen Sharma
Biological Trace Element Research (Published: 03 September 2026)

Abstract:
When lead exposure triggers systemic miRNA-31 induction and reduced Nrf2 expression, it deactivates the body’s systemic antioxidant defenses, leading to elevated oxidative stress, cellular inflammation, and heightened heavy metal toxicity. This specific molecular interaction is known as the miRNA-31/Nrf2 axis, an important epigenetic and redox framework that dictates how the body responds to lead poisoning.

In this observational cross-sectional study (n=160: 80 occupationally lead-exposed workers, median BLL 31.4 µg/dL vs 80 age/gender matched controls, median BLL 4.1 µg/dL), venous blood was analyzed for blood lead via Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (GFAAS). Relative expression of microRNAs (miRNA-31, miRNA-192) and target genes (Nrf2, NF-κB) was quantified using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Serum Nrf2 was measured by sandwich ELISA. Results showed marked 3.95-fold upregulation of miRNA-31 and 47% downregulation of Nrf2 mRNA (fold change 0.53, p < 0.001). Depleted serum Nrf2 directly correlated with elevated NF-κB inflammatory signaling and systemic reactive oxygen species (ROS) proliferation.

  const NIGERIA_CONFLICT = `The toxin nobody’s talking about in Nigeria’s Christian massacres

By Yona Sperling-Milner
Published July 15, 2026 8:00am ET 

Among the several ongoing conflicts in Nigeria, Western attention has turned especially to fatal clashes between Muslim-majority Fulani herdsmen and Christian-majority farmers. The issue has captivated the White House: President Donald Trump threatened in November that if “the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians,” the United States would “go into that now disgraced country, ‘guns-a-blazing,’” then followed through with airstrikes on Islamic State enclaves on Christmas Day.

Less than two months later, 162 people were massacred in Kwara state. Easter weekend brought more attacks, including a Palm Sunday killing of at least 20 in Jos.

The roots of the conflict are multifold and under dispute, but it comes against a backdrop of persistent, troubling violence in Africa’s largest country. And global leaders who want to turn down the temperature should consider an overlooked lever to calm the violence: the same policy that helped U.S. violent crime rates fall by more than half within a lifetime. Reducing the incredibly high prevalence throughout Nigeria of lead poisoning, which study after study has linked to aggression and violent behavior, could translate into significant reductions in the bloodshed plaguing the region.
